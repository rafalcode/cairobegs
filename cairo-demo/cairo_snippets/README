cairo_snippets is a collection of code for testing, and demonstrating
the cairo rendering API. Examine the Makefile for additional hints about
usage.

prepare_snippets - is a program used during the build process, it creates
    the snippets.c file, to create a new front end for cairo_snippets, look
    at the data and functions exported by snippets.c in snippets.h , by default
    during the build process all .cairo files in the current dir is included in
    the snippet collection.

cairo_snippets_png - writes a png file for each snippet

cairo_snippets_html - creates snippets.html, an index of the png's this is
    the page located at http://cairographics.org/samples/ , the header and
    footer of the page is read from header.html and footer.html

cairo_snippets_gtk - a gui displaying a list of snippets, the source for the
    currently selected snippet, and the rendered output, it uses GtkCairo,
    and thus utilitizes the Render backend by default, if cairo and GtkCairo is
    compiled with support for glitz, setting the enviroment variable GTKCAIRO_GL=1
    will use the glitz backend instead

cairo_snippets_ps  - makes a multipage ps document from all snippets
cairo_snippets_pdf - makes a multipage pdf document from all snippets

*.cairo - are the actual snippets, adding a new snippet requires you to add the
    snippet, and recompile, the Makefile should figure out that things have
    changed.
