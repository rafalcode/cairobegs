	I changed the class CairoSamples to use the 0.2.0 version of
	Murray Cummings newly released C++-bindings "cairomm". Futhermore
	I added two new samples that are derived from some experiments
	I did with the <canvas>-object and JavaScript. See the relating
	blog-entry on my homepage here: http://macslow.mine.nu/?p=25.
	It's nice to see the similarities of the cairo-API and the
	JavaScript-API for utilizing the <canvas>-object.

	Made the initial release on my blog at http://macslow.mine.nu and checked
	it in at cvs.cairographics.org (/cvs/cairo/cairo-demo/cairo-in-motion)
