finish the cairomm-related use of dealing with PNG-images (image, image_pattern,
moving_clip_image)

support for glitz-surfaces would be nice, so one can switch between "normal" and
glitz-surfaces at runtime to see the impact on performance

fps-couter

class CairoSamples should be a bit more sophisticated in dealing with the
function-pointers to all the included samples, this would also make do_sample()
a lot leaner

doing a fully dynamic (runtime-) loading of the samples would be the ultimate
goal, thus also ghosting (or hiding) those controlling widgets that don't affect
a particular sample

more cool-looking animated samples
