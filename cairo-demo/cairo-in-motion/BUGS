cairo-samples.cpp: everything dealing with PNG-images doesn't work yet, because
I moved all cairo-related things to use the new C++-bindings of cairomm-0.2.0,
therefore I disabled the execution of the cairo-samples/hacks:

	image
	image_pattern
	moving_clip_image

main.cpp: on_font_set() doesn't handle all font-attributes (slant, weight)
that can be found under the sun, it's just a quick hack to get some font-
-attributes over to CairoSamples

main.cpp: I don't know how to initially highlight/select the first (or just any)
row in the samples-TreeView

dragging of the handle-points isn't implemented yet

yes, I know it's currently slow as hell
