	* star_and_ring.c: Add example showing how to use
	CAIRO_OPERATOR_ADD to draw to interwoven objects without any
	seams.

2005-02-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* Makefile (MYCFLAGS): Use canonical libpn12 name for pkgconfig
	rather than libpng.

2004-11-11  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@freedesktop.org>

	* Makefile: removed read_png.c from Makefile, it's neither present in
	CVS repository nor used by examples, remove generated pngs when
	cleaning up.

	* snapping.c (snap_point_for_fill): Fix typo snapping y to x.
	(snap_line_width): Fix to maintain sign of width when clamping to
	maintain >= 1.0. Without this, a reflective transformation would
	cause the width to go negative and the line would disappear.

	* snapping.c (snap_point_for_fill, snap_point_for_stroke)
	(snap_line_width): Switch from integer truncation to floor() so
	that rounding works as desired with negative numbers.

	* snapping.c: Add demo showing how to do device-pixel-aligned
	graphics.
	Correct typo in comment.

2004-10-18  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* *.[ch] : replacing ct with cr

2004-04-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* write_png.c (unpremultiply_data): Use memcpy rather than
	assignment to avoid problems with unaligned pointers on particular
	machines.
	(unpremultiply_data): Missed one.
	(unpremultiply_data): Take three.

2004-04-06  David Reveman  <c99drn@cs.umu.se>

	* Makefile (EXAMPLES): Add text-rotate.

	* text-rotate.c: New program demonstrating text rotation.

2003-12-16  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* text.c (box_text):
	(box_glyphs): Add calls to cairo_text_path and cairo_glyph_path to
	demonstrate how to draw stroked (outlined) text.

2003-12-15  Carl Worth  <cworth@isi.edu>

	* text.c: Add boxes to demonstrate use of cairo_text_extents and
	cairo_glyph_extents. Add several text examples to demonstrate
	behavior of extents under various transformations.

2003-12-11  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>

	* Makefile (LDFLAGS): Use pkg-config to find libpng.

2003-12-10  Carl Worth  <cworth@east.isi.edu>
