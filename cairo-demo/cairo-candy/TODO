cairo-clock:
      - maybe add a date-display in the lower halve like chronographs have
      - maybe add a popup-menu and a settings-dialog
      - maybe allow easy theme-switching via command-line/settings-dialog
      - maybe save settings in a rc-file

wobbly-zini:
      - make some features settable via the commandline
      - maybe add drop-shadows
