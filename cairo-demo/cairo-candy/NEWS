The clock now uses a fixed set of SVG-files to determine its look. Thus it is
now possible to skin the clock. Just replace the 12 SVG-files with your own set
of files to give the clock your own personal style. Take note, that the
filenames are currently hard-coded. Open the default set of files in inkscape to
get an idea how to draw your own theme. In the near future proper theme-support
for the clock seems within reach. Furthermore the clock is no longer affected by
cairo-bug #5681.

The overall performance (refresh and redrawn) is much better now.

A few command-line options are available now. Here's the output of of the
command "cairo-clock --help":

Usage: ./cairo-clock
        --seconds (refresh every second and draw second-hand)
        --width <int> (open window with this width)
        --height <int> (open window with this height)
        --help (this usage-description)

And always remember... this is still work-in-progress. Now have fun with
creating your own clock-theme!
