There is nothing to install as such. Just do a make inside this directory and
everything should be ready to run after a few seconds. Be sure to have...

    gtk+ 2.8.x
	cairo 1.0.2
	librsvg 2.13.5
    some half-way decent compositing-manager (e.g. xcompmgr)
	Xorg 6.9/7.0 (with enabled Composite-extension)
	a good gfx-card with drivers that accelerate Render (e.g. GeForce-series)

running. That should put you in the position to compile and runs the eye-candy.
To my current knowledge such a setup is (at least the software-side) provided by
"Dapper Drake Flight 3" (current beta of "Ubuntu 6.04") and "Fedora Core 5 test
2" (obviously current beta of "Fedora Core 5").
