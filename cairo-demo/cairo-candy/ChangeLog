	* cairo-clock.c: Made cairo-clock compile again (updated rsvg_* calls)

	* ChangeLog: Fixed some of the formatting

2006-01-27 Mirco Mueller <macslow@bangang.de>

	The cairo-clock.c now uses librsvg to load all parts of the clock as SVG
	files. Some command-line paramters can now be use to alter the initial
	behaviour of the clock. Overall performance is much better now!

	On request by Carl Worth I'm doing the initial commit of this ahead of
	"schedule" so he has a few more bullets for his eye-candy-gun to fire at
	the crowed during linux.conf.au 2006 (gee, I'm talking out of my @!#?
	again :). I hope everybody will enjoy these early pretty-pixels. This
	stuff lands at the usual place at cvs.cairographics.org. I think...

		cvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/cairo/cairo-demo/cairo-candy

	will be a good place for those to live.
