	* sproing.c: (begin_paint), (draw_spline_grid),
	(draw_spline_spiral), (draw_wall): Update to the latest cairo API
	changes.

2005-04-18  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* sproing.c: (draw_ball), (draw_star): Track removal of
	cairo_set_alpha from cairo API.

2005-04-13  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* sproing.c (WALL_X, WALL_Y): Double the size of the wall spacing
	in each dimension.
	(draw_wall): Draw a solid color in the background of the wall area.

2005-03-28  Kristian Høgsberg  <krh@redhat.com>

	* sproing.c (model_step_object): Add simplistic collision
	detection experiment.

2005-03-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* sproing.c: (model_step_object), (sproing_button_release_event),
	(create_window): Increase default spring constant to 15. Release
	the immobile anchor point when the user releases the button.

2005-03-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* sproing.c: Reworked to have 2-way springs in the model, rather
	than 1-way attractors in the objects. The 2-way behavior lets us
	now pull any point around, (which is what's in place here). But
	the springs add a bit more bouncing than we'll actually want I
	think.

2005-03-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* sproing.c: (sproing_expose_event), (sproing_button_press_event),
	(sproing_motion_notify_event), (create_window): Remove old
	scribble names left over from some copy-and-paste.

2005-03-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* sproing.c: (sproing_expose_event), (sproing_button_press_event),
	(sproing_motion_notify_event), (create_window):

2005-03-28  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* sproing.c (scribble_button_press_event): Fix pixel-alignment bug
	on button press without motion.

	* .cvsignore: Added sproing binary to .cvsignore.

2005-03-11  Kristian Høgsberg  <krh@redhat.com>

	* COPYING: Convert this to UTF-8.

2005-03-11  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>

	* sproing.c: (model_init), (draw_spline_grid),
	(scribble_motion_notify_event): Add some strategic 0.5 offsets so
	that the patch settles down to pixel-aligned, width 1.0 lines.

2005-03-11  Kristian Høgsberg  <krh@redhat.com>

	* Makefile, sproing.c: New cairo demo.  Drag a wobbly patch around
	for fun.
