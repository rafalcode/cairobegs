# cairbegs
This repository stands for "Cairo Beginnings" alot of the programs dating from 2011 around the time 
I was doing to the Hulsenbeck simulation.

There's a good amount of building block code, taken from the cairo examples page. So some very simple
examples here too.

# hydots aka. slines
Well, what a nice surprise ... very much spirograph in action. Nice pale green with dashed lines and black background!
and what a shock .. I only the executable! No grep of slines anywhere. Tsk!
OK finally discovered this was hypdots. Don't know why I named it to slines ... well I can forget tht now ... it's hypdots.

# circnam and rectnam
Failry related these two, rectnam is better. However the interrect spaces are detectably twice the margins.
They should be independent, right? The side margins acould be massive but the inter rects should be the same.
So it does do to have rectas inside rects really. Actaully I've done this already for the 96 well imitation
